helloÔºÅ i thought i would write a little thing to preface the entire site. there are many blogs about tech art and games/3d technology that are much more polished and do a much better job of explaining or giving tutorials, but this is not that kind of blog. i maintain this blog solely as a kind of "learning diary" for myself. i'm trying to keep it unpolished but concise. the purpose is to document the process of learning and keep the gaps in knowledge visible. perhaps one day i will construct a separate site where i will publish polished tutorials with the purpose of instruction, and you will be able to find it in the list below!
